## Introduction
A data cleaning project by calling API and get JSON data from [FBI Most Wanted API](https://api.fbi.gov/wanted/v1/list).
I have done this project based on the guidance of [Evan Marie's project](https://jovian.ai/evanmarie/api-json-data-cleaning-project/v/1?utm_source=embed). 
This is only for practicing purposes to reinforce and learn more skills.
